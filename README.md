**Analyzing Long-Term Demographic Shifts and Dependency Trends in Sweden (1860–2022)
Project Overview**
This project explores long-term demographic trends in Sweden by calculating and visualizing the dependency ratio from 1860 to 2022. The objective is to understand how the proportion of the working-age population to dependents (children and the elderly) has shifted over time, and what these shifts imply for societal and economic planning.

**What’s Included**
**1. Dependency Ratio Calculation**
The analysis is based on population data from Statistics Sweden (SCB).

**The dependency ratio is calculated for each year using the following formula:**

Dependency Ratio = (Population aged 0–14 + Population aged 65+) / Population aged 15–64
This definition follows the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, where:

1.Dependents = ages 0–14 and 65+

2.Labor force = ages 15–64

**2. Visualizations**
Figure 1: A line graph showing the dependency ratio in Sweden from 1860 to 2022.

Figure 2: A comparative plot showing the fraction of:

Children (0–14)

Elderly (65+)

Total dependents
relative to the total population.

**3. Analytical Discussion**
Discussion on major demographic changes based on the figures.

Insights into historical events (e.g., the World Wars) and their demographic impacts.

Interpretation of broader trends like lower birth rates, population aging, and life expectancy.

**Methodology**
Data was processed and grouped into relevant age categories.

Yearly dependency ratios were computed from structured data.

Charts were created to visually track and compare demographic shifts.

Analysis was documented in a report with visual references.

**Data Sources**
Statistics Sweden (SCB) – Historical population by age and sex

World Health Organization (WHO) – Definition and framework for dependency ratio

**Key Findings**
A significant drop in the dependency ratio occurred between 1915 and 1940, likely due to reduced birth rates during wartime.

The proportion of elderly individuals in the population has risen steadily over time.

The fraction of children has gradually declined, which is a typical trend in developed nations.

These demographic shifts may present challenges in the future, including a reduced labor force and increased need for elderly care.
